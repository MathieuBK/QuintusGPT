# QuintusGPT

QuintusGPT is a chatbot application that simulates a conversation with the french indie hacker Quentin Roiseux. The chatbot provides valuable IT & cybersecurity info/advice to users, drawing from both Quentin's experience and insights. It also has access to the transcriptions of all pages of [the ANSSI website](https://cyber.gouv.fr/) - the french National Agency for the Security of Information Systems - which are used to provide context and support for the chatbot's responses.


## Features

- Engage in a conversation with a chatbot that emulates Quentin's communication style.
- Receive focused, practical, and direct IT info/advices.
- Access relevant snippets from transcriptions of ANSSI's website pages to support the chatbot's responses.
- Utilize semantic search to find relevant content from the transcripts.
